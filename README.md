- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Linux system administration, web development and improving my interpersonal communication skills.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Bash, Python, C, HTML/CSS/JS and Sage.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project. A niche zoner would be much appreciated as well. Btw Rust interests me.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with efficient coding, timed-update systems in Linux systems and time management.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything FOSS or Technical or diverse, I'm in.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Hunt me down
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: There have been a lot of resources and opportunities that its hard to focus on one. Perhaps, I should shut myself down a bit and focus on one thing at a time.
*I use Arch btw.*
